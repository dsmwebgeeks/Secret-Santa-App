# Dojo Challenge

Scope:
— The secret Santa app allows a user to build his/her own secret Santa group.
— Santa groups are a collection of users participating in a secret Santa event where gifts are purchased and delivered secretly. Groups are created by an admin. 
— The admin defines the parameters around the group such as who is involved, what the price limit on gifts are, time and date of event, etc. Once a group is initiated group members are invited to join.
— Group members involved in a secret Santa group have to confirm their involvement, suggest 2 - 3 gift ideas under the suggested cost cap, and answer a question such as “what was your favorite gift”.
— The secret Santa app automatically assigns secret Santas and alerts each group member of their Santa responsibility.

Requirements
— Responsive design (bonus points for using Phone Gap)
— Database development
— Server setup
— Fancy design
